The model's main features are intolerance of uncertainty, beliefs about worry, poor problem orientation and cognitive avoidance, Subjects were 24 GAD patients and 20 non clinical control subjects. The results show that all main components of the model were highly related to the discriminant function and that intolerance of uncertainty was pivotal in distinguishing GAD patients from non clinical subjects. Further, the discriminant function derived from these four process variables was very effective for classifying GAD patients and non clinical subjects into their respective groups. Overall, 82{\%} of subjects were correctly classified as 18 of 24 subjects in the GAD group and 18 of 20 subjects in the non clinical group were properly identified. The results are discussed in terms of the proposed model of GAD and its clinical implications.},

@article{Fava.2015,
 abstract = {Background: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are widely used in medical practice. They have been associated with a broad range of symptoms, whose clinical meaning has not been fully appreciated. Methods: The PRISMA guidelines were followed to conduct a systematic review of the literature. Titles, abstracts, and topics were searched using the following terms: 'withdrawal symptoms' OR 'withdrawal syndrome' OR 'discontinuation syndrome' OR 'discontinuation symptoms', AND 'SSRI' OR 'serotonin' OR 'antidepressant' OR 'paroxetine' OR 'fluoxetine' OR 'sertraline' OR 'fluvoxamine' OR 'citalopram' OR 'escitalopram'. The electronic research literature databases included CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, PubMed and Web-of-Science from inception of each database to July 2014. Results: There were 15 randomized controlled studies, 4 open trials, 4 retrospective investigations, and 38 case reports. The prevalence of the syndrome was variable, and its estimation was hindered by a lack of case identification in many studies. Symptoms typically occur within a few days from drug discontinuation and last a few weeks, also with gradual tapering. However, many variations are possible, including late onset and/or longer persistence of disturbances. Symptoms may be easily misidentified as signs of impending relapse. Conclusions: Clinicians need to add SSRI to the list of drugs potentially inducing withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation, together with benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and other psychotropic drugs. The term 'discontinuation syndrome' that is currently used minimizes the potential vulnerabilities induced by SSRI and should be replaced by 'withdrawal syndrome'. © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.},

@article{Hengartner.2019,
 abstract = {Withdrawal reactions when coming off antidepressants have long been neglected or minimised. It took almost two decades after the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) entered the market for the first systematic review to be published. More reviews have followed, demonstrating that the dominant and long-held view that withdrawal is mostly mild, affects only a small minority and resolves spontaneously within 1-2 weeks, was at odd with the sparse but growing evidence base. What the scientific literature reveals is in close agreement with the thousands of service user testimonies available online in large forums. It suggests that withdrawal reactions are quite common, that they may last from a few weeks to several months or even longer, and that they are often severe. These findings are now increasingly acknowledged by official professional bodies and societies.},

@article{Hengartner.2022,
 abstract = {The efficacy of antidepressants in the acute treatment of moderate-to-severe depression remains a controversial issue. The minimal important difference (MID) is relevant to judge the clinical significance of treatment effects. In this analysis paper, we discuss estimates of the MID for common depression outcome measures.For the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 17-item Version (HDRS-17), according to both anchor-based and distribution-based approaches, MID estimates range from 3 to 8 points, and the most accurate values are likely between 3 and 5 points. For the 6-item version (HDRS-6), MID estimates range between 2 and 4 points. For both the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II), MID estimates range between 3 and 9 points, with estimates of 3-6 points likely being the most accurate. Quality of life appears to be more important to patients than core depression symptoms. We thus also evaluated the Short-Form 36 (SF-36) mental component score, a popular mental-health-related quality of life measure. Its MID estimate is likely about 5 points. By contrast, the average treatment effects of antidepressants on the HDRS-17, HDRS-6, MADRS, BDI-II and SF-36 are 2 points, 1.5 points, 3 points, 2 points and 3-5 points, respectively.In conclusion, the efficacy of antidepressants in the acute treatment of moderate-to-severe depression consistently fails to exceed the lower bound of the MID estimates for common depression outcome measures. The clinical significance of antidepressants thus remains uncertain and we call for more research on quality of life measures, which are the patients' most valued outcome domains.},

This method, together with random assignment of patients to treatment modes, was devised to permit comparison of treatment modes within a program, but it also provides a good basis for a judgmental evaluation of the total program.},

@article{Leigh.2018,
 abstract = {Social anxiety disorder is a condition characterised by a marked and persistent fear of being humiliated or scrutinised by others. Age-of-onset data point to adolescence as a developmentally sensitive period for the emergence of the condition, at a time when the peer group becomes increasingly important. Social anxiety in adolescence is associated with considerable impairment that persists through to adulthood. There are clear potential benefits to delivering effective interventions during adolescence. However, there is limited evidence on the specific efficacy of available therapies. This is in contrast to adults, for whom we have interventions with very specific treatment effects. One such treatment is individual cognitive therapy. Cognitive therapy is based on the cognitive model of social anxiety proposed by Clark and Wells (in: Heimberg, Leibowitz, Hope, Scheiber (eds) Social phobia: diagnosis, assessment and treatment, The Guilford Press, New York, 1995). The present review examines the potential application of this adult cognitive model to the understanding of adolescent social anxiety and considers additional adolescent-specific factors that need to be accommodated. It is suggested that a developmentally sensitive adoption of the cognitive model of social anxiety disorder (Clark and Wells 1995) for adolescents may lead to better treatment outcomes.},

@article{Micallef.2001,
 abstract = {Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a brain disorder with recognizable periods of onset, course, familial occurrence, epidemiology, phenomenology, and treatment response. Several manifestations of pathophysiology are beginning to be defined, although they may represent intermediate pathophysiology rather than primary etiology. Positron emission tomography studies have consistently identified hypermetabolism in the orbitofrontal cortex, caudate nucleus, and, sometimes, anterior cingulate cortex. Neuropsychologic testing frequently identifies abnormalities in visuospatial function. Abnormal levels of cerebrospinal fluid neurotransmitters and neuromodulators are identifiable in untreated patients with OCD and return toward normal levels after effective treatment. The most consistent pathophysiologic finding in OCD points toward an abnormality in serotonin neurotransmission. Therapeutic response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and the absence of improvement with norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and dopamine antagonists argue strongly for a role of serotonin in the pathophysiology and treatment of OCD. Despite this clear indication from treatment trials, probes and manipulations of the serotonin system and its specific receptors have not provided a useful understanding of specific abnormalities. Clomipramine or potent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the pharmacotherapy of choice for OCD, with a more limited role reserved for monoamine oxidase inhibitors. If one selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor is ineffective, others may be beneficial, in addition to the different proserotonergic and nonserotonergic augmentation strategies that could be useful in treatment of resistant OCD patients. Nondrug therapies are also important in OCD: behavioral therapy is frequently helpful and neurosurgery is sometimes helpful when other treatments fail.},

@article{Topp.2015,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND
The 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) is among the most widely used questionnaires assessing subjective psychological well-being. Since its first publication in 1998, the WHO-5 has been translated into more than 30 languages and has been used in research studies all over the world. We now provide a systematic review of the literature on the WHO-5.
METHODS
We conducted a systematic search for literature on the WHO-5 in PubMed and PsycINFO in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. In our review of the identified articles, we focused particularly on the following aspects: (1) the clinimetric validity of the WHO-5; (2) the responsiveness/sensitivity of the WHO-5 in controlled clinical trials; (3) the potential of the WHO-5 as a screening tool for depression, and (4) the applicability of the WHO-5 across study fields.
RESULTS
A total of 213 articles met the predefined criteria for inclusion in the review. The review demonstrated that the WHO-5 has high clinimetric validity, can be used as an outcome measure balancing the wanted and unwanted effects of treatments, is a sensitive and specific screening tool for depression and its applicability across study fields is very high.
CONCLUSIONS
The WHO-5 is a short questionnaire consisting of 5 simple and non-invasive questions, which tap into the subjective well-being of the respondents. The scale has adequate validity both as a screening tool for depression and as an outcome measure in clinical trials and has been applied successfully across a wide range of study fields.},

 abstract = {Traditionally, hoarding symptoms were coded under obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), however, in DSM-5 hoarding symptoms are classified as a new independent diagnosis, hoarding disorder (HD). This change will likely have a considerable impact on the self-report scales that assess symptoms of OCD, since these scales often include items measuring symptoms of hoarding. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of one of the most commonly used self-report measures of OCD symptoms, the Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R), in a sample of 474 individuals with either OCD (n = 118), HD (n = 201), or no current or past psychiatric disorders (n = 155). Participants with HD were diagnosed according to the proposed DSM-5 criteria. For the purposes of this study the OCI-R was divided into two scales: the OCI-OCD (measuring the five dimensions of OCD) and the OCI-HD (measuring the hoarding dimension). Evidence of validity for the OCI-OCD and OCI-HD was obtained by comparing scores with the Saving Inventory Revised (SI-R), the Hoarding Rating Scale (HRS) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). Receiver operating curves for both subscales indicated good sensitivity and specificity for cut-scores determining diagnostic status. The results indicated that the OCI-OCD and OCI-HD subscales are reliable and valid measures that adequately differentiate between DSM-5 diagnostic groups. Implications for the future use of the OCI-R in OCD and HD samples are discussed.},
